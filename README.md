## Inspiration
- Ever since the pandemic hit India over five months back, followed by an unprecedented lockdown, stress levels have been on the rise with 43 per cent Indians suffering from depression, according to a new study. Every one in 20 Indians suffers from depression. It is estimated that from 1990-2012, India had over 258,000 suicides, with the age-group of 15-49 years being most affected.
- When you search on google about mental health there is no such result that can assist the depressed person properly. There are results that either ask you for a test or provide the name of good psychiatrist.
